This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered when using the Expo CLI. The issue revolves around seemingly random network connectivity problems during application runtime.  The error messages provided by Expo are often unhelpful, making debugging challenging.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code (a simplified example), and `bugSolution.js` offers a potential solution and explanation.
